<p dir="auto">It is really important to see or be aware of how our mind creates suffering. Normally, there is what we call "natural suffering" and "self-created suffering." Self-created suffering actually does not really exist. It does not exist on the relative level — not on the true relative level, or the healthy relative level. And, of course, at the absolute level, nothing exists; everything is emptiness. As I mentioned before, there is the unhealthy sense of self, the healthy sense of self, and the luminous self. Self-created suffering is connected with the unhealthy sense of self. And that is totally delusion and illusion, even on the relative level.</p>
<p dir="auto">But then, what does exist on the relative level is natural suffering. What are the differences between self-created suffering and natural suffering? For example, if you have a sickness, then in general you have problems with your physical body. That is natural.</p>
<p dir="auto">We have what we normally call the "four rivers of suffering." One is being born. When you are being born, there is a lot of suffering. Then, there is getting old. When we get older, there is a lot of suffering. Then, there is sickness. Sickness is also natural suffering. And dying is also natural suffering. You cannot really control it. It is the true relative level; it exists on the relative level. So, what do you have to do? You have to accept it.</p>
<p dir="auto">But then, there is the fear of death and dying, fear of or aversion to sickness, or fear of getting old. There is a lot of craving, not wanting whatever you have, or looking for some perfect image of yourself or an unreasonable image of yourself. You want to have youth forever. You do not want to get old. Or you want a perfectly healthy body and to never get sick.</p>
<p dir="auto">These create a lot of extra problems. Of course, I am not saying that you should not keep young; of course, for the relative level, we should do physical exercise and be aware of our diet. And we have to follow a rhythm of good sleep and balance in our life. You can try your best to keep your body healthy and mind happy. All of this is no problem.</p>
<p dir="auto">The problem is when we have a lot of that in our mind and we are creating a lot of things in our mind, and we do not see whatever positive things we have. Normally, we say that if there are ten qualities within us, and nine of them are positive and one is negative, we only look at the negative one and exaggerate it. And we do not see the nine good qualities within us.</p>
<p dir="auto">Maybe I should tell you a short story. One time, I was at the monastery where we have a stupa. And around the stupa, there are a lot of small stones stuck in the ground. But they are not completely even, and some stones come up here and there. And normally, if we go around the stupa, we have to take off our shoes, so we have to walk barefoot. So for me, it was very uncomfortable because the stones hurt my feet. And I always really wanted to go around the stupa, but when I thought about the stupa I thought about those rocks, and I felt a lot of resistance. So when I walked, each step was suffering, like "I appreciate this wonderful stupa. Oh, pain!" I would feel a lot of suffering. Then one time, I went to the West for a full checkup. The doctor said, "Your health is good, but you have to do more physical exercise." And one of the exercises was to walk on pieces of rock barefoot. That is more like an Asian doctor's advice. And the doctor said that around the feet there are so many different points that are good for the organs and the entire body. He told me all the details, and I was really surprised that walking barefoot on stones is so good for health. Then, I finished my tour and went back to my monastery, and I tried to circle around the stupa. Then I remembered, "Oh! There are rocks here!" And I was quite happy. I had been thinking, "Where could I find those stones?" But actually, they were right there. Then, I walked barefoot on the stones. I felt very good. "I am doing exercise, and each step feels very nice and happy." But the pain was still there. So, the pain with the feet is natural suffering. A few months before, that pain had become very uncomfortable for me. That is self-created suffering. But later, the pain became a cause of happiness. So knowing how the mind creates suffering is really important. And that is not only with those pieces of stone but with everything in our life. It is connected with our relationships. The more expectations we have, the more sensitive our mind becomes. Then we will see all these negative aspects.</p>
<p dir="auto">Normally, people come to me and ask me to pray for them, and they say, "I want to find my soulmate." Mr. or Mrs. Perfect. And they have a long list. Please bless me to find a partner who is a meditator in the same lineage. And someone who is there for me and understands me. A long list. And I tell them, "Okay, I can pray, but, well, there is no such thing as Mr. or Mrs. Perfect. You might find Mr. or Mrs. Okay. That is okay! Accept it." And they say, "Please pray." And sometimes they come and say, "I found them!" When I hear "I found them," I think "uh oh" in my mind. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] "That is a big problem." Then you have these big expectations, and the mind becomes so tight. Then what happens? The relationship normally does not last very long.</p>
<p dir="auto">Maybe I will tell you a story about a car. Let's say, if you like a car, maybe your favorite car — a BMW, a Mercedes, or nowadays we have Tesla, right? Many people like Tesla. You really want to have that car, and you are saving money to buy it. And one day you go into town, and you see your dream car. And you are so happy. "Wow!" While you are looking at the car, suddenly a truck comes and crashes into the car. So, what happens? Of course, you feel sorry about it, but you might take photos, you know? Of course, you feel sad, but, at the same time, excited. "Now my dream car is broken!" And you can put the photo of it on Facebook or Instagram or whatever. Then, a few weeks later, you might think, "My savings may not be enough to buy my dream car. So I will go for a second-hand car. That is easier." So one day you decide to buy a second-hand car and go into town to the second-hand car shop. There, you see a car — your dream car, second-hand — and you really like it and you want to buy it. But, actually, that car is the same as the one that, a few weeks ago, had the accident that you saw. But you do not know that it is the same car. Then, you buy the car and sign for it, maybe around 3 p.m., and make a down payment. "Now, the car belongs to me. It is my car." Right after 3 p.m., it becomes your car.</p>
<p dir="auto">Then it depends on you whether you have strong grasping or not. I will mention more about grasping later. Normally, we have three concepts that we call "singularity," "permanence," and "independence." If you do not know the details of these now, do not worry. We have these three combined together with the car. The tighter your mind is about your car, the more expectations you have, the more suffering you will have. While you are driving your car, maybe the road is not so good, and it might have bumps. If the road is bumpy, with each bump, your heart jumps. Your hair stands on end, and you get goosebumps. Then maybe you drive into the countryside and the road is not so good. And then the wheel spits a piece of stone upward, and that stone comes down and hits your windshield. "Tak!" The moment you hear the "tak!" what happens? It seems like a knife cutting through your heart. You almost have a heart attack. But, actually, the car is the same. Three weeks before, that car had an accident with another car, and you did not have this knife-cutting-through-your-heart experience, you know? You might have felt sorry. But even if the car was totally smashed, you would not have had big suffering. But now, after 3 p.m., when just one stone hits the windshield, it is almost like you are going to have a heart attack. Why? Because of the grasping.</p>
<p dir="auto">Then, if you continue with that car, then what will happen after a few weeks is that you might think, "Oh, this car is not what I expected." You will see a lot of problems. "Oh, the gearshift is no good. The shape is not good. And this kind of feature is not good. And that kind of feature is not good." Then you cannot really appreciate the car. You see all of its problems. Of course, there is always some problem, but now the entire car is a problem. You cannot enjoy the car.</p>
<p dir="auto">That is a small example of how our mind creates suffering. In English, there is a phrase for this: "We make a mountain out of a molehill." It is a small bump, but we make it a mountain.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's do a simple exercise. Try this. Hold your hand here [Mingyur Rinpoche holds out his fist in front of him, with his thumb extended], and close one eye [Mingyur Rinpoche covers one eye with his other hand]. You see the thumb, right? Now bring your thumb close to your eye. [Mingyur Rinpoche draws back his thumb until it is directly in front of his eye.] Closer, closer, closer . . . What do you see now? Your thumb. Now, look to the right [Mingyur Rinpoche turns his head, keeping his thumb in front of his eye], and you see the thumb. Now, look at the left, and you see the thumb. Look up, and you will also see the thumb. Look down, and you will see the thumb. Now, bring it out far away from your eyes. Farther, farther . . . Now, what you see is the thumb and many things around it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here, it is the same thing. With our grasping mind, when it is too tight with a singular, independent, and permanent view, we slowly make small problems into very big problems. And we do not see big problems. If you have a big problem in your life, you will not see it. Instead, you see everything as being the fault of that small problem.</p>
<p dir="auto">Therefore, we know how our mind makes a prison. Actually, we put ourselves into our own prisons. And who creates this prison or jail? We create it. Therefore we can free or liberate ourselves from it. All of these teachings in level three are about how we can liberate ourselves from our own prison.&nbsp;</p>
